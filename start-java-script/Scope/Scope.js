/*
JavaScript has 3 types of scope

    1. Block scope
        create with let and const
    2. Function scope
        create a variable insive a funcion
        Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.
    3. Global scope
        Automatically Global
        If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
