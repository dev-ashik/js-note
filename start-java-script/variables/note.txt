Values

=> The javaScript syntax defines two  types of Values
    1. Fixed Values (fixed values are called 'Literals'.)
    2. Variable values (Variable values are called 'Variables'.)



=> javaScript use the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.


=> 4 ways to declare a jabaScript variable.
    1. var (The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.)
    2. let  ( If you think the value of the variable can change, use let. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.)
    3. const (If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.)
    4. use nothing

Identifiers
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.

    The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
        1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        2. Names must begin with a letter
        3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
        4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
        5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names


=> A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.


*** let ***

=> Redeclared
    let (Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.)
    but Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed:
    
    let x = 2;    // Allowed

    {
    let x = 3;    // Allowed
    }

    {
    let x = 4;    // Allowed
    }


    var
    With var you can Redeclared

=> let and const Block Scope
    {
    let x = 2;
    }
    // x can NOT be used here

=> var keyword Global Scope
    {
    var x = 2;
    }
    // x CAN be used here




***** const *****
    variables defined withconst can't be redeclaared.
    Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
    Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
